## Little Red Riding June
By way too many people










Once upon a time there was a young holly berry named June. She was going to deliver milk to her sister Lily. Her mom, Judy said “Watch out for wolves” “I wil” said June. “Also watch out for Julie” called Judy. But June had already left.

 
June was walking and walking and walking and walking. Then she stopped to take a rest. Meanwhile, Julie was watching and was interested to see what was in June’s basket. When she saw June take out a bottle of milk, she decided she needed the milk. June quickly put the milk back in.



“Wiwy need milk, so I keep waking” said June. Then Julie jumped out of the bushes. “Hey you not wof” said June. “Of course I’m not a woof. Did you think I was a dog?” said Julie. “Byee” said June. “Oh, before you go, where are you going?” asked Julie. “Me go to Wiwy house” said June. “Bye.” said Julie. 



Then, Julie started following June. “Why you follow me?” asked June. “Umm” said Julie. “I bet you want the milk” said June. “No I don’t” said Julie. “Yes you do” said June. “I think it’s time for a battle” said Julie. So Julie shot fire at June, but June protected herself with a fireproof leaf.



Then, June made little baby plants jump on Julie’s head, but Julie burned them. Then Julie accidentally started juggling fireballs and June started laughing. Then Julia came in. “What is going on here?” she shouted. “Me need to get milk to Wiwy but Julie tried to get milk from me” said June. “Okay get your milk to Wiwy or whatever, June” said Julia. “Julie is grounded for a week” 


June got the milk to Lily. When she got home, Judy asked, “Did you come across any wolves? Or Julie?” “Ummmmmm,” said June.


Not the end
