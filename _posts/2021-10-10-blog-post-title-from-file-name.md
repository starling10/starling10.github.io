## Sleeping Julie

Once upon a time, there was a queen named Queen Julia. Now, Queen Julia had always wished for a baby. 
Then, one day her wish came true. Her baby was a beautiful little hydrangea. 
She was having a party and had invited the three fairy godmothers, June, Lily, and her sister Judy. 
When they had arrived, Fairy June said, “I will give the baby the gift of beauty!” 
Fairy Lily said, “I will give the baby the gift of intelligence!” 
Then, the evil Rosalie van Winkle came out and shouted, “HOW DARE YOU FORGET TO INVITE ME! I will make sure the baby dies when she is poked by a thorn!” 
They all gasped with shock. 
Thankfully, the fairy Judy said, “O humble Julia, I too have a wish. I will give her the power that if she is pricked by a thorn, she will fall asleep and only be woken by the kiss of a noble bee.” 
Then she sprinkled some dust on the baby and left. 
Now the baby- whose name was Julie- was about sixteen months old.  She was walking round the palace when out the window, she saw an old, old village rose - who happened to be Rosalie Van Winkle in disguise - and felt pity on her, because she looked so cold as everyone did in the winter months.
Julie wanted to let her in the palace, but when Queen Julia saw the thorns in her back pocket, she said “No way, Princess Julie!”
She then left, but the old rose stood there, looking pitiful. “Poor old rose,” she thought. She opened the door and checked the room behind her to make sure no one was there before she invited her in. 
And then, while she was looking back, the old rose stabbed Julie with the thorns.
She ran away so no one would find her and hurt 
her, but Queen Julia saw a rose running away.
And she also saw Julie lying on the ground.
She gave a shriek, and at once the three fairies came to her aid.
“Fairy Judy!” she wept. “Fairy Lily! Fairy June! The stranger stabbed darling Julie with her thorns and now she’s dead!”
“She’s not dead, your majesty,” said Judy.
“My gift simply made this: she is asleep and only the kiss of a fairman from the northlands can save her. That is all I can say.”
And leaving Julia crying, she picked up Julie’s body and lay her on a silken bed.

In the northlands there lived a noble bee- or maybe he was a regular bee as he had a freckle on his butt (don’t tell me you learnt it the hard way!)- but he was honest and brave, and went by the name of Bumbly. His favorite thing to do was to watch videos of giant robots. Secretly, he wished to marry a princess as beautiful as himself.
So he decided to seek out a truly buzz-utiful princess living along the old cliffs.
“I will not let you go!” wept his mother, Honey.
“I think he should,” declared Queenie, his silly aunt. “Who knows, he might find his long lost hairclip!”
“Auntie, I don’t have HAIR,” said Bumbly. “I’m going to seek a beautiful princess!”
He then, without waiting for an answer, went outside seeking a princess.
After two months he was losing hope when he spotted a large bramble brush. And no, not the hair type of brush.
“Hey! My hairclip!” he exclaimed.
The moment he touched it, it spun around and began to point at the spiky brambles.
“Holy mustard!” cried Bumbly. “How can I get over that?”
As if to answer, the non-hair clip pointed to his... wings?
“I have wings?!” he asked. “How splendid!”
So he tried flying, but he forgot he broke them when he was two. So he basically jumped through a bunch of non-magic thorns.
“That was nauseating!” he cried. “Owch!”
He painstakingly, maybe even heroically, climped- climbed and limped - over the thick brush.
“Whewf-ee!” he cried. Then he realised he was in the castle’s backyard.
He ate all the food on the dining table that was outside from Julie’s baby shower. And then he burped. Really loudly.
It happened to wake up Julie for five seconds, enough for her to yell, “HELP!” but then she fell back asleep.
Queen Julia - a much older Julia - heard the burp and the yell, and wondered if it was the noise of the huntsman who came regularly to chop down brambles and slay wild boar. “I am the noblest of all fairmen and I will save you, ‘help’!” shouted Bumbly. 
Julia wondered if the huntsman was going cray-cray.
Mr. Noblest-of-all-fairmen opened his green knapsack and pulled out two umbrellas, a tent, some rotten pie cake, mustard - 
But where was the rope?!
After a month of hiding near the brambles, he found it. “Now the noblest of all fairmen will chop the trees and build a house for you, my dearest ‘helpomania!’” Bumbly announced.
After another month, he built it and climbed up the ladder.
“Itsy bitsy bee-bee went up the ropey spout, down came the rope and knocked the bee-bee out… He became the noblest of all the rope climbers!”
By now, Bumbly was tired and needed to rest. He realized (again!) that he was next to a castle. Slowly, he crept inside. The first thing he said was, “SHOW YOURSELF TO THE NOBLEST OF ALL ROPE CLIMBERS AND FAIRMEN!!!”
Bumbly went upstairs. Eventually he made it to Julie’s room. He declared, “You are my princess and I shall marry you!” Slowly he kissed Julie. Then Julie woke up. As soon as she woke up, Queen Julia came in and said, “You saved my daughter! Would you like to marry her?” “Of course! I decided that myself!” declared Bumbly. Looking confused, Julia introduced Julie to Bumbly. Then, they had a royal wedding. “I told you he would find his long lost hairclip!” Queenie whispered. Honey just shrugged. And Julie and Bumby  lived happily ever after. The best part is that they never ever saw Rosalie Van Winkle again.



## Not the end!
             Seriously, why does it have to be so bold?
               Stop talking Julie!
