 I am Lily. I am so excited to have my own private diary! Let's start the story from last week. So, it was a Monday. Or was it a fingynail? Wait fingynails aren’t days. They’re just some silly thing June made up.
Anyways, on that day I was playing in the garden. Wait, we don't have a garden. Then I saw June. June had brought Julie’s disgusting stew outside and started jumping in it. Did I mention that the stew smells so bad!
Then I got hungry for something cool and refreshing. Well can you blame me? It was so hot outside! I went inside to get a glass of ...wait for it… milk! I went to the fridge, expecting to see milk on the second row. But there was no milk! Aaaaaaah!!! I guessed that it wasn’t Julie because she must have learned a lesson from being grounded. She probably also learned a lesson from the milk chase.
So, I said (or wrote. What? I’m still getting used to talking!) to June, “You took my milk!” June said she had been playing in the garden all day. I said sorry. I also said that we don’t have a garden. I keep on mentioning that. Why doesn’t anyone listen to it?
Then I went to Mila and Lila. I said, “you took my milk!” They had said that they don't even like milk! Whaaaaaaaaaat? Well, you can’t expect everyone to like what you like.
So, I couldn't think of anyone to ask. I decided to set up a video camera to catch the thief! Two hours later I was called for bed. When I was sleeping, I had a dream that I was a famous detective. I think Catalina would do better at that job. When I woke up, I went to see the camera. But when I went there my milk was gone and the video camera was broken!
I cried a lot until June came. Then I asked June to play in the garden. Oops, I forgot my own point. I meant that I asked June to play in the outside space. Then we heard a noise. We went inside but didn't see anything. June said that it might be Judy washing the dishes. I agreed. But on the inside, I was thinking, what if that was the milk thief?

I set up another camera. This time I stuck it on with Hailey hibiscus’s super-duper plant glue. I went to bed again. This time I dreamed that I caught the milk thief. That was my favorite dream ever! When I woke up, the milk was stolen but the video camera wasn’t broken. Oops. I forgot to turn on the video camera.
Something just struck me. I should ask Catalina to help me. When I got to the office, I saw Catalina at a professional looking desk. I asked her to help me solve the case. She said that she will get started right away. She asked for any evidence. I gave her the empty milk bottles and the pieces of the camera.
I went home. When I went to my room, I saw that June had peed on my bed! Again! Then I saw Seriously and Bumbly outside the window. Fighting pretend crime. Again.

I just realized that I should ask them to fight “crime” (aka the milk thief). Same answer as Catalina. Except they didn’t ask for evidence. I wondered when they would solve the mystery. So, I decided that I would have to solve the mystery.
Now Seriously and Bumbly are dancing so they can defeat a pretend giant robot. They said that the robot wants to look at their butts and they did not allow that.
I am tired. I will try to solve the case tomorrow. If you figure out who the thief is, contact me. My website is Lily+milk=fun.com.

Today, my family got into a fight or something. Well, at least June wasn’t in the fight. I heard them say stuff like “we can't use that” or “Allie can help”. I was confused.

I just went to my room and drew until Judy called me for meals. Then, I went to sleep.

I’m sorry there isn’t much in this entry.

Today, Judy (mommy!) told me that we were getting a pool. I was wondering how we would dig that much. Judy must have read my mind because she said that Allie would be digging the pool and filling it with water.
I said that I would be in the kitchen. And you guessed it. My milk was missing. Again. By the way, no one knew who the thief was.



### Dear Diary,                              11/14/21
Hello and I am going to swim in the pool today! I am so excited! I got my swimming trunks (if I have any) and my swim cap. The pool was so much fun. I even got to go to the deep end!
Then I decided to watch my favorite show, Milky way. I saw a long ad about hair spaghetti. Finally, the show started. In this episode, they are looking for the chosen ones. Hello! One of the chosen ones is looking right at you!
In the evening I was fussing because I really wanted my milk. As always, I was called for bed. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a dream.


### Dear Diary,                                   11/15/21

So today it is raining. I know you are thinking “isn’t rain good for flowers?” Well today it is really raining. Like really. Mommy said that babies or little kids cannot go outside. So, I was stuck in our little mushroom house. I had asked Mommy “why can't we buy a bigger house?” She said that the mushroom house has been something passed down for generations and now it is our turn.
So, I was stuck sitting on the couch with June, reading one of her books. At least the book was good.
Now, it has stopped raining. But it is too late to go outside. Today, I am having a sleepover with Catalina and Gillian. We are going to use this opportunity to catch the milk thief. Yay! They have arrived! Catalina has brought magnifying glasses for us. Mommy let us watch a movie.
We watched a movie called hair spaghetti. Then we got to eat food. We all were hoping for milk. But the milk thief struck again.
And Catalina saw a glimpse of green.
So, from what I can tell, they:
1)have to be a plant
2)are definitely a plant
3)can’t be a human
I asked mommy when we can have another sleepover. She said next week. I went to the fridge. But there was no milk:(. Right now, June is writing a book and Julie is playing loud music and crying. She says she is crying because she thinks that Bumbly will get attacked by the giant robot. And Julia and Judy are doing some house chores.

I went to bed. When I woke up, it was the middle of the night. I heard some noises. I went downstairs. I saw a glimpse of blue this time.
I went back to bed. When I woke up, I heard everyone making the mustakes- I mean mistakes again. I heard Queenie saying
 “I meant bunny. I meant funny. I meant sunny!” 
I am glad to be in my room.
I can’t believe I am without milk for 2 weeks now. I hope we can catch the milk thief. I got a message from Catalina. She has some evidence about the milk thief. Here is her evidence
She thinks they:
Have to be a plant
Are definitely a plant
Can’t be a human
Isn’t that the same evidence as mine? Oh wait, mine had numbers. Bumbly and Seriously didn't get anything. I don’t think they will ever get anything.
Oh look, they are fighting for cookies. Ha, they are fighting each other. And-Bumbly-said-the-h-word! I also heard Judy washing the dishes, but when I went downstairs no one was there.
Well, Julie was there, crying. I am starting to get tired of that noise. Oh look, June finished her book. I am going to read it.
The book was really good. It was so good. It was about me being a milk detective!!!!! She said the book is for me. I gave her the June statue I made from empty milk bottles. She loved it.
Now it is sunshine time for the older flowers. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Oh wait, I can change the sun. I did that after some time. Now I am heading to the nursery. Ahh. First up (for me) entertainment! Today I am going to tell everyone the story of the milk thief (so far).
Yay! Everyone loved it. Even Daphne. And as you know she is usually grumpy.
The sad news is that I am not close to finding the thief.
Although, I do have a sleepover coming up. I am going to invite everyone I know! I need to make plans. I am filling out the plans sheet.
Next week! I can’t wait! Just next week! I am getting the games, food, movie, and books ready! Oh, there was a knock on the door. It’s Allie! And she has milk for me! Ahh. Finally, some milk. I will make a chart on how many times the thief struck.
I need a plan. No not a planning sheet, a plan to catch the milk thief. For now, I will review June’s milk detective book to find ways to catch the thief. Wait, Allie is still here. I should thank her. Thank you, Allie! I think I will draw a picture of me for now.
June thinks I am a good… what’s that word… oh yeah drawer. No wait, I think it was an artist. Whatever, she wants me to draw pictures for the great milk chase, her latest book! I am getting started on drawing a milk carton.




### Dear Diary,                                   11/17/21

I am getting ready for the sleepover, (it’s tomorrow!) June is making copies of the sleepover books, and Julie is… still crying!? Ugh!
I had an idea to catch the milk thief! I will use the milk I got from Allie at the sleepover party so the milk thief will come and get it. Surely the milk thief is someone I know in disguise. I am putting my milk in my secret stash. My secret stash has a lock, and I am the only one with the key. I will start setting up. Oh, it is bedtime. I can hardly wait for tomorrow. Not only are we having a sleepover, but we are also finally going to catch the milk thief!



### Dear Diary,                                 11/18/21

Yes! The sleepover is today. I am sooo excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am first gathering everyone in the house and then I will gather nursery friends, then I will gather far-away neighbors such as Corpsi or Vera.
Oh, look, they are here!!! We get started by playing detectives. Then we play bean bag toss. Judy won. Then we play flower power battle. I won!!! Julia called us for dinner.
Laid out before us are all the foods you can imagine, except milk. I am saving the milk for later. And maybe I will share some with my friends when it is reading time. Then we watch the movie. It was so good! Then, I set up the milk and then we read. Everyone loved the books. Then we hear a noise. 
We creep downstairs. We see Julie! She is sleepwalking and taking my milk! Looks like I was wrong! We get Julie in trouble while Bumbly cries because we called Julie a thief.
Then we all had a milk feast! When we finished the milk, we made milk bottle towers. We made a super huge one!!! I think this was the best sleepover ever.
Oh, well that’s my story. It was nice talking to you! Goodbye!
-Lily (who is always 😡 at Julie)
Not the end!

As I told you, this is not the end! I will be sharing more experiences, like this one. 
So, I’m living a happy life, having a happy time. Then, I head to the kitchen to get some milk. Yes, the milk is there! I open the fridge and drink some refreshing milk. What? Were you expecting a problem? Well,  yes there was a problem. I FOUND A PRESENT FOR ME! It was more milk! So, it’s not a problem, it’s a mystery!	
Obviously, the first thing I do is call Catalina.
And the whole thing will happen over again. And June didn’t even let me call her Madam Junalie the 5667th! No fair!
